# UX
 
* As an everyday client I want to experience a User Friendly application that is easy to understand and take usage of.
* The visitor is the individual who is a client of LOVE THERAPY. The application helps the client to get a better structure. 
* They will experience an ordinary, but different kind of application page. Not too much focus on the design, but more focus on the actual data and functions.

# REASONS FOR DEVELOPMENT
 
* I (Colin Hammarberg) am developing/building this application to create an E-commerce store that offers high end and exclusive clothing to support charity. With all profits going to the charity of the customers choice, we are able to create a beatiful supplyment of clothing, but at the same time support charity organizations all around the world.
